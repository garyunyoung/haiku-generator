***Haiku Generator***

This project was created as a final project for the Code First Girls Spring 2019 Course.

For this project, our goal was to create a website using concepts learnt during the course. 

At the moment all the Haikus are hard-coded however, in the future I would like to implement the RiTa library (a toolkit for natural language and computational literature) to generate Haikus, as well as a Haiku rating system. 

Created using: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and jQuery.
